Q: How did you organize your files?
Ans: I downloaded 3 files from Spotify database and use this in the program, i created 6 files including LinkedList, MyApp, MyQueue, Playlist, Song and SongHistoryList in which Song class is a node class, MyQueue and Playlist are queues, SongHistoryList is a stack, and we used all of things in MyApp and created a menu.

Q: How did you build your playlist?
Ans: I made a queue to keep track of all songs, after reading all files, i merged all of the MyQueue objects to create a big MyQueue and iterate through all of the items and add songs into the Playlist object and the end.

Q: How did you track the recently listened to tracks
Ans: I created a stack of Song node named as SongHistoryList, whenever we play a song, it will add that song name on top of SongHistoryList and we can checkout the history by popping Song nodes from the top.
